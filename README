Welcome to my Gentoo Overlay!

There are some ebuilds for bleeding edge software in here.
If something doesn't work, please let me know.

To start using it, just follow theses steps:


mkdir -p /usr/local/portage

cd /usr/local/portage

git clone git://github.com/skylex/skylex-overlay.git

echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/portage/skylex-overlay"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf


Enjoy!
